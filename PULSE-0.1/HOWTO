This program adds instrumentation to modules so that the scheduler
can control them. Use it at the Erlang shell as follows:
  > c(instrument).
  > c(driver).
  > c(dot).
  > c(scheduler). % If the BEAM file is not up-to-date.
  > instrument:c(examples).
  > driver:drive(fun examples:example0/0).
You'll get a trace of your program's execution, and in schedule.dot
you'll find a Graphviz graph that you can turn into a picture with
  dot -Tpng < schedule.dot > schedule.png.

You can also write
  > instrument:c(examples, scheduler).
to specify a different scheduler module, or
  > instrument:c(examples, scheduler, [foo, bar])
if you only want to instrument example:foo and example:bar, or
  > instrument:view(examples).
to see the instrumented code.
